SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE NOT LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
  AND NOT RIGHT(CITY, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

LEFT(CITY, 1) extracts the first character of the city name.
RIGHT(CITY, 1) extracts the last character of the city name.
NOT IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') excludes cities that start or end with a vowel.
AND ensures that both conditions are satisfied.

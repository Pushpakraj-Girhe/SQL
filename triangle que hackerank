🛠️ SQL SYNTAX EXPLAINED
Here’s the full query again with explanation:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END AS TriangleType
FROM TRIANGLES;
💡 Explanation by parts:
🔹 SELECT
It’s used to retrieve data from a table.

🔹 CASE
This is like an IF-ELSE ladder in SQL.

sql
Copy
Edit
CASE
  WHEN <condition1> THEN <value1>
  WHEN <condition2> THEN <value2>
  ...
  ELSE <default_value>
END
🔹 WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
This checks for invalid triangles.

🔹 WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
All sides are equal.

🔹 WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
Any two sides are equal.

🔹 ELSE 'Scalene'
This is the default case when none of the above match — means all sides are different.

🔹 AS TriangleType
Gives a name to the output column.
